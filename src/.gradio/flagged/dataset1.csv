"During the Advisory Boardâ€™s April 1921 inspection tour, how many sanitary facilities were visited in five days?","We were camped in a small camp on the outskirts of the Soviet frontier, in the mountains. The camp was on the far side of the river, which is on the other side of the river. There was no railway, no transport for the people, and the only way to get there was to go over the frontier.

There were two camps at the camp, one on the left and one on the right. The camp was at the right, on the left, and the camp on the right.

We were sent to the same place where the Soviet Army was camped",2025-04-22 15:08:17.245181
